    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><h3>Step 1</h3></strong>
            Whisk mustard powder, fish sauce, ½ tsp. demerara sugar, and 1 Tbsp. very hot water in a medium bowl until sugar is dissolved; season with salt and plenty of pepper. Add steak to bowl and turn several times to coat. Let sit while you make the vinaigrette. </li>
        <br><li><strong><h3>Step 2</h3></strong>
            Whisk chile, lime juice, 2 Tbsp. olive oil, and remaining ½ tsp. demerara sugar in a large bowl; set vinaigrette aside. </li>
        <br><li><strong><h3>Step 3</h3></strong>
            Heat vegetable oil in a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Add steak and cook, turning every couple of minutes, until nicely browned and medium-rare, 7–10 minutes. Add butter to skillet, then tilt skillet toward you and use a large spoon to baste steak with foaming butter for a minute longer. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. </h3></strong></li>
        <br><li><strong><h3>Step 4</h3></strong>
            Meanwhile, add watercress, cucumbers, and mint leaves to bowl with reserved vinaigrette and toss to combine; season salad with salt and pepper. Top with peanuts and drizzle with olive oil. </li>
            <br><li><strong><h3>Step 5</h3></strong>
            Slice steak and serve with salad. </li>
